Physijs
=======

### Note: This fork of Physijs is compatible with newer Three.js, like r135
The code is identical to the original [Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs), except for:
- old Geometry is replaced with BufferGeometry;
- class definitions are made compatible with Three.js classes
- all but one of the examples is updated

These modifications are not thoroughly tested. There might be other parts of Physijs that need changes.

For details and API specification visit [Chandler Prall's Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs).
