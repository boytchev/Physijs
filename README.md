Physijs
=======

### This fork of Physijs is compatible with newer Three.js, like r135

The code is identical to the Chandler Prall's [Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs), except for:
- old Geometry is replaced with BufferGeometry;
- class definitions are made compatible with Three.js classes
- all but one of the examples аре updated

These modifications are not thoroughly tested. There might be other parts of Physijs that need changes.
